## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-17

- Calf has intelligence now! (I'm not sure if Intelligence of a calf, is artificial or not, so I'm not sure about using AI here, or CI) You can simply use your favorite AI tool to easily generate a calendar event described as a text in normal human language. For example you can copy/paste a text from your invitation email, or a tweet or where ever you want and Calf will fill the form and create the event for you.

## [0.3.4] - 2025-12-11

- There is a new option in the "Share" mode to "Edit/Clone" the shared event.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-11

- The "Link" toggle has been removed. Now it tries to detect if it's a link or a location

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-28

- Move About button from footer to top-right
- Change "Online" toggle label to "Link". So it basically means people can type any link, for example google maps link instead of typing the address
- Move the "Link" toggle to left, easier to spot and meaningful decision order
